## Intro to Tidy modeling

This repository contains the resources used for a brief (~1hr) introduction to tidymodels. 

The slides `xaringan.Rmd` very, very briefly introduce the fundamentals of the tidymodels (parsnip, recipes, and rsample).

During the slides, I walk through `audio_classifier.R`. This creates a lyric classifier as outlined in [mirr](https://mirr.netlify.com).

This model is then "productionalized" with plumber (`plumber.R`), and then wrapped in a small Shiny app (`app.R`).
